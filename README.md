## High-level System Overview

## Protocol Design 👷‍♂️

Wombat protocol adopts a monolithic smart contract design where a single implementation contract, i.e. `Pool.sol`, inherits multiple contracts for extended functionalities, such as `ownable`, `initializable`, `reentrancy guards`, `pausable`, and `core algorithm` contracts. These inherited contracts provide access-controlled functions, and the ability to `pause` or `upgrade` the implementation contract (_also serves as main entry point of Wombat protocol_).
